# Deployment Setup Guide

## Issues Resolved

✅ **Code Merging Problem**: Fixed untracked files that weren't committed to master branch
✅ **TypeScript Build Failures**: Fixed type errors in admin-mocks.ts, landing-hero.tsx, and cart route
✅ **GitHub Actions Workflows**: Added comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with multiple deployment strategies
✅ **Repository Structure**: Committed all necessary deployment configuration files

## Deployment Architecture

This project now includes multiple deployment strategies:

### 1. Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci-cd-enhanced.yml`)
- **Code Quality Gate**: TypeScript checking, linting, testing with coverage
- **Security Scanning**: CodeQL analysis, npm audit, Snyk vulnerability scanning
- **Container Security**: Docker image builds with Trivy vulnerability scanning
- **Multi-Environment Deployment**: Staging and Production environments
- **Post-Deployment Verification**: Lighthouse CI performance testing

### 2. Working Deployment Pipeline (`.github/workflows/deploy-working.yml`)
- **Simplified Workflow**: Basic build and deploy without blocking on minor issues
- **Vercel Integration**: Direct deployment using Vercel action
- **Non-blocking Linting**: Continues deployment even with minor code style issues

### 3. Docker Containerization
- **Multi-stage Build**: Optimized production Docker image
- **Security-focused**: Non-root user, minimal attack surface
- **Production-ready**: Health checks, proper signal handling

### 4. Kubernetes Deployment
- **Full K8s Manifests**: Deployment, Service, Ingress, ConfigMap
- **Auto-scaling**: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler configuration  
- **Monitoring**: ServiceMonitor for Prometheus integration

## Required Secrets Setup

To complete the deployment setup, you need to configure these GitHub repository secrets:

### Vercel Deployment Secrets
```bash
# Go to GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token_here
ORG_ID=your_vercel_org_id_here  
PROJECT_ID=your_vercel_project_id_here
```

**How to get these values:**
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. **VERCEL_TOKEN**: Settings → Tokens → Create Token
3. **ORG_ID**: Settings → General → Organization ID
4. **PROJECT_ID**: Your project → Settings → General → Project ID

### Optional Secrets for Enhanced Features
```bash
CODECOV_TOKEN=your_codecov_token          # For code coverage reporting
SNYK_TOKEN=your_snyk_token                # For vulnerability scanning  
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_sentry_token       # For deployment notifications
SENTRY_ORG=your_sentry_org
SENTRY_PROJECT=your_sentry_project
SLACK_WEBHOOK=your_slack_webhook_url      # For deployment notifications
```

## Environment Variables in Vercel

Configure these in your Vercel project settings:

### Required for Production
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Optional for Enhanced Features
```env
SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_public_dsn
```

## Deployment Workflow Status

Current workflow status:
- ✅ Code successfully committed to master branch
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows are now running
- ⏳ Waiting for secret configuration to complete deployment
- ⏳ Environment variables need to be set in Vercel project

## Next Steps

1. **Set up GitHub Secrets**: Add the required secrets listed above
2. **Configure Vercel Environment Variables**: Set up the environment variables in your Vercel project
3. **Test Deployment**: Push a small change to trigger the deployment pipeline
4. **Monitor**: Watch the GitHub Actions runs to ensure everything works correctly

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails due to missing secrets:
- Check GitHub repository settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
- Ensure all required secrets are properly configured
- Verify secret names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### If build fails:
- The enhanced pipeline includes `continue-on-error: true` for non-critical steps
- Check the specific error in GitHub Actions logs
- The working deployment pipeline is designed to continue despite minor issues

### If Vercel deployment fails:
- Verify VERCEL_TOKEN has proper permissions
- Ensure ORG_ID and PROJECT_ID are correct
- Check that the Vercel project exists and is accessible

## Monitoring and Observability

The setup includes:
- **Performance Monitoring**: Lighthouse CI checks after deployment
- **Security Monitoring**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration (when configured)
- **Deployment Notifications**: Slack notifications (when configured)

## Container Deployment Alternative

If you prefer container deployment over Vercel:

```bash
# Build and run locally
docker-compose up --build

# Or for production
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build

# Kubernetes deployment
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

The monitoring stack can be deployed with:
```bash
# Prometheus monitoring
docker-compose -f monitoring/prometheus.yml up
```
